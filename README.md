# Predicting EUR/USD Exchange Rate

## 1. Introduction:
The aim of our project is to develop a predictive model for forecasting the EUR/USD exchange rate. We will leverage machine learning techniques and the technologies we've learned, such as Python's Scikit-learn library, Pandas, Matplotlib, and potentially other tools like SQL databases.

## 2. Scope and Purpose:
Our project will focus on analyzing historical data of the EUR/USD exchange rate and building a machine learning model to predict future exchange rate movements. By doing so, we aim to assist traders, financial analysts, and businesses in making informed decisions regarding currency trading, investment strategies, and risk management.

## 3. Key Questions:
- What are the significant factors influencing the EUR/USD exchange rate?
- Can historical patterns and trends in the exchange rate data be effectively captured and utilized for predictive modeling?
- How accurately can we forecast short-term and long-term movements in the EUR/USD exchange rate using machine learning algorithms?

## 4. Data Sources:
We will explore various sources for obtaining historical EUR/USD exchange rate data, including financial data repositories, API services, and potentially curated datasets from platforms like Kaggle or data.world. Ensuring the quality, reliability, and legality of the data will be a priority, adhering to copyright regulations and usage terms.

## 5. Proposed Approach:
- **Data Collection:** Retrieve historical EUR/USD exchange rate data spanning several years to capture a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean, preprocess, and format the data to remove noise, handle missing values, and ensure consistency.
- **Feature Engineering:** Identify relevant features and potentially engineer new ones, such as moving averages, volatility measures, economic indicators, and sentiment analysis of news articles or social media.
- **Model Selection:** Experiment with various machine learning algorithms suited for time series forecasting, such as linear regression, ARIMA, LSTM neural networks, or ensemble methods.
- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Train the selected models on historical data, validate their performance using cross-validation techniques, and fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize predictive accuracy.
- **Model Deployment:** Deploy the trained model to predict future EUR/USD exchange rates, possibly through a web-based interface or API for accessibility.

## 6. Expected Outcomes:
- A predictive model capable of forecasting EUR/USD exchange rate movements with a reasonable level of accuracy.
- Insights into the key factors driving fluctuations in the exchange rate and their predictive significance.
- Potential applications for traders, financial institutions, and policymakers in risk management, investment decision-making, and macroeconomic analysis.
